## 2.3.1 DC path and AC path

### I. DC path
$U_i=0$

the DC path can help you tell whether the DC path is right or not.


### II. AC path

1. the DC source setting in zero

what we consider now is that we have no DC source for it to pass easily.

so the capacity can be seen as the path 


## 2.3.2 Graphic Method

$$i_B=\frac{V_{BB}-V_{BE}}{R_b}$$![[Screenshot 2025-10-21 at 17.31.14 1.png]]

so it's clear to see that the Q point(the static working point)

when the Q point is fixed, we can just stick around it, and we just focus on the $\frac{\Delta U_{BE}}{\Delta i_B}$.

## 2.3.2 the equivalent circuit Method

### I. the DC path

1. the Q point
where is it ?
and whether it's  reasonable?

2. $r_{be}$

$r_{be}=r_{bb} + (1+\beta)\frac{U_T}{I_{EQ}}$

$r_{bb}$ is the resistance of the base region.
it has nothing to do with the working status, its resistance is made in the factory.

### the AC path
