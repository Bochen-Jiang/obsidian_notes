## 2.1.2 The concept of amplifier

**Take an audio amplifier, for example: it amplifies a weak signal into a stronger one, where 'stronger' means more than just higher voltage or current.What we amplify is power

### I. The characteristic
the amplifier of power

### II. The essence
the switch(control) of power
### III. the necessary condition


## 2.1.2 how to construct a basic amplifier circuit 

goals: a weak signal $\to$ a stronger one 
conditions: 
*how:*：a BJT, to amplify the circuit.


### the principle of the amplifier circuit

we can think an amplifier circuit, which must contain BJT or FET, ect.. But as we learned before, if we want these components to work normally, we must have some direct voltage, but these DV is not the things we want, what we need is actually the AV(AC), that passes the signals, so we use a capacitor to avoid the DC(DV), thus we can amplify the tiny signal we input.


> 把三极管想象成一个​**​水龙头系统​**​ 👇

- ​**​Ib（基极电流）​**​ 就是你用手拧水龙头的​**​“开度指令”​**​，它控制的是​**​进入的水流（基极电子注入）​**​
    
- ​**​Ic（集电极电流）​**​ 就是​**​最终从水龙头流出来的大水流​**​
    
- ​**​Vce（集射电压）​**​ 就像是​**​你家水管出口到水池之间的压力差​**​
    

##### 在放大区：

- 你拧水龙头的力度（Ib）决定了水流大小（Ic）。
    
- 只要出口压力（Vce）不是太低（>1V 左右），水流基本就只看你拧的力度，跟出口压力关系不大。
    
    > 所以 ​**​Ic ≈ β × Ib​**​，这就是​**​线性放大​**​的基础！
    

##### 在 Vce 很小的时候：

- 水压不够，水流还没完全打开，所以 Ic 还受 Vce 影响较大。
    
- 一旦水压足够（Vce > 1V 左右），水流就顺畅了，主要由你拧的力度（Ib）控制
Imagine a transistor as a ​**​faucet system​**​ 👇

​**​Ib (base current)​**​ is like the ​**​"opening command"​**​ when you turn the faucet handle—it controls the ​**​incoming water flow (injection of base electrons)​**​.

​**​Ic (collector current)​**​ is the ​**​main stream of water flowing out of the faucet​**​.

​**​Vce (collector-emitter voltage)​**​ is like the ​**​pressure difference between your home’s faucet outlet and the sink​**​.

In the ​**​active (amplification) region​**​:

The force with which you turn the faucet (Ib) determines the water flow (Ic).

As long as the outlet pressure (Vce) isn’t too low (above ~1V), the water flow mainly depends on how much you turn the handle, not the pressure itself.

Thus, ​**​Ic ≈ β × Ib​**​, which forms the basis of ​**​linear amplification​**​.

When ​**​Vce is very low​**​:

The water pressure is insufficient, so the flow hasn’t fully opened—meaning Ic is still significantly affected by Vce.

Once the pressure is adequate ($V_{ce}$ > 1V), the water flows smoothly, primarily controlled by how hard you turn the faucet (Ib).
