Compared with PN Junction, the current is smaller in the same voltage, while the reverse current will be greater.


#### the influence of temperature
based on the upper graph, as the temperature rises, the forward current shifts left, the reverse will shift down.

## 1.2.3 二极管的主要Main parameters of a diode


1. $I_F$ :Maximum rectification current (the maximum average forward current a diode can safely conduct during prolonged operation)   
2. ${U_R}$ :最高反向工作电压
在标定$U_R$的时候，不能直接取UBR(反向击穿电压)，大概是取50%的UBR

3. $I_R$ ：热击穿时的反向电流
The smaller $I_R$ is, the better the diode is.

4.  $f_M$ : the maximum operating frequency

when the frequency is small, the $\omega$  is small, the capacitive reactance, 

which equals to $X_c = \frac{1}{2\pi fC}$ is very big, as it grows, the reactance is very small.

which makes the diode almost free-resistance.

so it has a $f_M$ to help control the diode.


## 1.2.4 Equivalent Circuit of a Diode


### V-I characteristics
graph: the equivalent circuit based on piecewise-linearized V-I characteristics

graph(a): the diode strictly adheres to unidirectional conductivity:

**In the forward direction,  it behaves like a wire; in reverse, it acts like an open circuit.**

so it's very ideal. 


graph(b) : so when the u is not big enough, i will change, that's definitely right, but we can ignore the change, under some conditions, but when the voltage exceeds the $U_{on}$ , the current suddenly grows fast 






## III. 


it has a direct current called $I_D$

also,
we similarly see it as a dynamic resistance



when we analysis this circuit,


![[Notes Of Physics_副本.jpeg]]

$i_d = I_s(e^{\frac{U}{U_T}}-1)$

 

$$
\begin{gathered}
\frac{\Delta U_D}{\Delta i_D} = r_d \\\\
\frac{1}{r_d}=\frac{\Delta i_D}{\Delta U_D}=\frac{d i_D}{dU_D}=I_s · \frac{1}{U_T}·e^{\frac{U_D}{U_T}} 
= \frac{I_Se^{\frac{U_D}{U_T}}}{U_T}\\\\
r_d = \frac{U_T}{I_D}
\end{gathered}
$$

### III. The small-signal equivalent circuit of a diode

1. first, find the dot of the graph, determine the operating current $I_D$ of the circuit under the DC conditions.
2. $r_d = \frac{U_D}{I_D}$ 






## 1.2.5 Zener diode(voltage-regular diode)

### I. Characteristics

Based on the different breakdown voltage, we can make the diode different zener diode.
