## 1.4.1 Junction Field-effect Transistor(JEFT)
## 1.4.2 Mental Oxide Semiconductor Field-effect Transistor(MOSFET)

as the MOSEFT can replace the most functions of JEFT, we focus more on discussing the functions and structures of the MOSEFT.

###  ​ N-channel Enhancement-mode MOSFET

#### I. its structure

s: the source electrode
g: the gate electrode
d: the drain electrode

# the explanation of Parameters
$U_{GS}$: the voltage between the gate electrode and the source electrode.

*what it does:* It ​**​controls the conductivity of the channel​**​ and thus determines whether current can flow between Drain and Source.


$U_{DS}$: the voltage between the drain electrode and the source electrode.

*what it does*:It controls how much current flows from the ​**​Drain​**​ to the ​**​Source​**​, through the conductive channel.
$i_D$: the current 

$I_D$: the current flowing from drain to source.
*strongly depends on the $U_{DS}$ and $U_{GS}$*



#### II. the working principle

(1) when $u_{DS}=0$, the influence of $u_{GS}$ to the conductive channel.

for N-channel MOSEFT,  the conductive channel is formed by electrons.
while for P-type MOSEFT, the conductive channel is formed by holes.

 so a simple way to understand its working principle is to view it as a tap.

**you have to turn on the faucet(the $u_{GS}$) for water(the electrons or the holes) to flow.**

(2)when we consider the influence of the **$u_{DS}$ to $i_D$,** so now we have to **fix the** $u_{GS}$, and also to make the EFT work normally, $u_{GS}$ **needs to satisfy** $u_{GS}>U_{GS(th)}$

the picture up is how the voltage is.


when $u_{CD} = U_{GS(th)}$, the FET reach the pinch-off statement, if the $u_{DS}$ still rises, the $i_D$ will not rise.

then comes a question can we make a FET that we don't have to provide extra voltage to let itself have a channel?

## N-channel depletion-mode MOSFET

we can tell the difference between the enhancement-mode and the depletion-mode FET.





## Junction Field-effect Transistor(JFET)



*So, compared to the MOSFET—which is like a normally closed faucet— the JFET is more like a normally open_one. You have to turn it the opposite way(reverse the bias) to reduce the flow of water.*

| Default statement | the channel exists,$i_D$ is large                                | has no channel,  $i_D \to 0$                                |
| control mode      | apply a negative voltage$\to$enhance the channel$\to$$i_D$ grows | apply a negative voltage$\to$suppress the channel$\to$$i_d$ |

## 1.4.3 The characteristic curves and parameters of a field-effect transistor (FET)

### I. The characteristic curves
 $$i_D=I_{D_0}(\frac{U_{GS}}{U_{GS(th)}}-1)^2$$
 based on the FET curves, we can easily know how to draw the curve of the JFET, just shift it, and change the $i_{DO}$ into $i_{DS}$
