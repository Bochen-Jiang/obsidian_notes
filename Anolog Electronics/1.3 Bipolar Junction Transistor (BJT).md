### I. Composition

it has three regions: **the emitter region, the base region, the collector  region.**

the three regions each one has a electrode.

**thus, three regions can form two PN junctions.**



the emitter region is the area with the highest carrier concentration among the three regions, and thus it is the most heavily doped.

the collector region should have a larger area and lower doping concentration to ensure it can accommodate the carriers emitted by the emitter.

the base region should be very thin, the reason why it should be thin listed as below.

## 1.3.2 Current amplification effect

### I. Amplification

Under some specific conditions, the current $I_c$ will be $\lambda$  times $I_b$

### II. Basic Common-Emitter Amplifier Circuit

When we apply a voltage on to the transistor, the emitter-base PN junction is forward-biased, allowing current to flow --- this is called forward bias.

### III. **Movement of internal charge carriers**


#### 1. the emitter junction is forward-biased

A forward-biased emitter junction eliminates the barrier between the two regions, allowing free electrons from the emitter to diffuse into the base.

**the movement of the internal charge carriers in the transistor and the external current**

$I_{EN}$ : the free electrons in the emitter region move towards base region forming the $I_{EN}$

$I_{EP}$ : the holes in the base region moving towards the emitter generates the $I_{EP}$


#### 2. The base region

The electrons in the base region undergo three primary processes: diffusion, recombination, generation.

assuming that there are 100 electrons, 98 of them will be directly go to the collector region, while two of them (the electrons) will either ​**​move too slowly​**​ or ​**​become trapped in the base region​**​, where they are ​**​captured by holes​**​—a process known as ​**​recombination​**​. However, the base region ​**​swiftly replenishes​**​ new holes and free electrons. The newly generated free electrons will contribute to $​I_{BN​}​$ (an extremely small current).

### IIII.​ Amplification factor​​

1. $\overline{\beta}$

$$\overline{\beta}=\frac{I_{CN}}{I_{BN}}=\frac{I_C-I_{CBO}}{I_B+I_{CBO}}\approx \frac{I_C}{I_B}$$

**Alternating current amplification factor​**
​
 $\beta=\frac{\Delta I_c}{\Delta I_B}$ common-emitter

but in the vast majority of cases, their numerical values are identical.​

they are common-emitter, which means that the emitter electrode is used as the common terminal.


2. $I_{CEO}$ ：the ​**​Reverse Cutoff Current between Collector and Emitter with Open Base($I_B=0$)**

3. $I_{CBO}$ ：the reverse current

4. $\overline{\alpha}$ : $\alpha=\frac{I_C}{I_B}=\frac{\overline{\beta}}{1+\overline{\beta}}$

they are common-base, meaning that the base electrode is used as the common terminal.


## 1.3.3 ​Common-Emitter (CE) Characteristics Curve of BJT

### Input Characteristic

​When studying three variables, we first fix one variable and then analyze the relationship between the other two.

*the output characteristic curve of transistor*

1. active region
$i_B=\beta i_C$

2. cutoff region

*Both junctions reverse-biased with CE open-circuit​*
as long as the base voltage is lower than the emitter voltage, we can bias the transistor into cutoff region.

3. saturation region

The charge carriers within the device are fully conducting, yet the output current no longer increases linearly with the input signal.

Both junctions are forward-biased, akin to a closed switch.

till now, the $i_C$ is no longer growing linearly with $i_B$.

$$
\begin{gathered}
i_C = \frac{V_{CC}-U_{CE}}{R_{c}}\\\\
i_B = \frac{V_{BB}-V_{BE}}{R_b}
\end{gathered}
