## 1.4.1 Junction Field-effect Transistor(JEFT)
## 1.4.2 Mental Oxide Semiconductor Field-effect Transistor(MOSFET)

as the MOSEFT can replace the most functions of JEFT, we focus more on discussing the functions and structures of the MOSEFT.

###  ​ N-channel Enhancement-mode MOSFET

#### I. its structure
![[截屏2025-10-10 17.03.58.png]]
s: the source electrode
g: the gate electrode
d: the drain electrode

# the explanation of Parameters
$U_{GS}$: the voltage between the gate electrode and the source electrode.

*what it does:* It ​**​controls the conductivity of the channel​**​ and thus determines whether current can flow between Drain and Source.


$U_{DS}$: the voltage between the drain electrode and the source electrode.

*what it does*:It controls how much current flows from the ​**​Drain​**​ to the ​**​Source​**​, through the conductive channel.
$i_D$: the current 

$I_D$: the current flowing from drain to source.
*strongly depends on the $U_{DS}$ and $U_{GS}$*



#### II. the working principle

(1) when $u_{DS}=0$, the influence of $u_{GS}$ to the conductive channel.

for N-channel MOSEFT,  the conductive channel is formed by electrons.
while for P-type MOSEFT, the conductive channel is formed by holes.

 so a simple way to understand its working principle is to view it as a tap.

**you have to turn on the faucet(the $u_{GS}$) for water(the electrons or the holes) to flow.**

(2)when we consider the influence of the **$u_{DS}$ to $i_D$,** so now we have to **fix the** $u_{GS}$, and also to make the EFT work normally, $u_{GS}$ **needs to satisfy** $u_{GS}>U_{GS(th)}$

the picture up is how the voltage is.


when $u_{CD} = U_{GS(th)}$, the FET reach the pinch-off statement, if the $u_{DS}$ still rises, the $i_D$ will not rise.
