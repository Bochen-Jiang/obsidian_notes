it has three regions: **the emitter region, the base region, the collector  region.**

the three regions each one has a electrode.

**thus, three regions can form two PN junctions.**



the emitter region is the area with the highest carrier concentration among the three regions, and thus it is the most heavily doped.

the collector region should have a larger area and lower doping concentration to ensure it can accommodate the carriers emitted by the emitter.

the base region should be very thin, the reason why it should be thin listed as below.

## 1.3.2 Current amplification effect

### I. Amplification

Under some specific conditions, the current $I_c$ will be $\lambda$  times $I_b$

### II. Basic Common-Emitter Amplifier Circuit

When we apply a voltage on to the transistor, the emitter-base PN junction is forward-biased, allowing current to flow --- this is called forward bias.

### III. **Movement of internal charge carriers**


#### 1. the emitter junction is forward-biased

A forward-biased emitter junction eliminates the barrier between the two regions, allowing free electrons from the emitter to diffuse into the base.
